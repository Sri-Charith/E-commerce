| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Props   | Like handing a letter personally to each person               |
| Context | Like putting it on a shared notice board â€” anyone can read it |

ðŸ”¹ What is React Context?
React Context is a way to share data globally across components 
without passing props manually at every level. 
It solves the problem of prop drilling 
(passing data through multiple layers).
